  	 Measurement is always somewhat arbitrary because the value of any variable in part depends on how it is deﬁned. In addition,it is easy to see that there is more than one way to measure abstract concepts such as “love,”“family,”or “intelligence.” Good research therefore requires that sociologists operationalize a variableby specifying exactly what is to be measured before assigning a value to a variable.Before measuring the concept of“social class,”for example, you would have to decide exactly what you were going to measure—say,income level,years of schooling,or occupational prestige.Sometimes sociologists measure several of these things; in such cases, they need to specify exactly how they plan to combine these variables into one overall score.The next time you read the results of a study, notice the way the researchers operationalize each variable. How they deﬁne terms can greatly affect the results. Even the researchers at the U.S.Census Bureau sometimes struggle with operationalizing a concept. Take the case of measuring the racial and ethnic diversity of the U.S. population. Back in 1977, researchers at the U.S. Census Bureau deﬁned race and ethnicity by asking people to make a choice from this list:white,black,Hispanic, Asian or Paciﬁc Islander,and American Indian or Alaska Native.One problem with this system is that someone can be both Hispanic and white or black; similarly,people of Arab ancestry might not identify with any of these choices.Just as important,an increasing number of people in the United States are multiracial.
  	  Getting a valid measurement is sometimes tricky. Say you want to know just how religious the students at your college are.You might decide to ask students how often they attend religious services.But is going to a church, temple, or mosque really the same thing as being religious? People may attend religious services because of deep personal beliefs, but they may also do so out of habit or because others pressure them to go. And what about spiritual people who avoid organized religion altogether? Even when a measurement yields consistent results (making it reliable),it may not measure what we want it to (and therefore lack validity). Chapter 19 (“Religion”) suggests that measuring religiosity should take account of not only participation in prayer services but also a person’s beliefs and the degree to which a person lives by religious convictions. Good sociological research depends on careful measurement, which is always a challenge to researchers.
